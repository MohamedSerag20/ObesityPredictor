## Data Cleaning and Classification Learning Project

Welcome to our project on GitHub! Our team has developed a Python-based solution that focuses on data cleaning and classification learning. The project involves reading data from an Excel sheet, cleaning it by removing inconsistencies and noise, and then applying classification learning techniques to predict future results. We are proud to share that our project achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 95.54% during performance testing.

### Features

- Data Reading: The project reads data from an Excel sheet, allowing for easy integration with existing datasets.
- Data Cleaning: We have implemented robust algorithms to clean the data, removing any inconsistencies or noise that may affect the accuracy of the classification learning process.
- Classification Learning: Our project utilizes classification learning techniques to analyze the cleaned data and predict future results.
- Performance Testing: We have thoroughly tested the project's performance by comparing the predicted results with the actual results. The achieved accuracy rate of 95.54% demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution.
